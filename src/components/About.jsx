      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am Manasvi Vilas Sutar, currently pursuing my B.E in Computer Science
        and Engineering at MVJ College of Engineering. I work on full-stack web
        development and create clean, user-friendly interfaces through UI/UX
        design using Figma. I also have solid knowledge of DBMS, MongoDB, C,
        C++, and Java, along with fundamental understanding of cybersecurity. I
        enjoy building functional, modern projects and continuously improving my
        technical and design skills. I also participated in the “Decodex”
        Capture-the-Flag competition at BMSIT&M, where I performed strongly
        across multiple cybersecurity challenges. I’m actively seeking
        internships and collaborative opportunities to apply my skills in
        real-world development.
